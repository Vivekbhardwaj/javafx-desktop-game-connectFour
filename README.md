# javafx-desktop-game-connectFour
A basic desktop game called "Connect Four" development using javaFx

The project can be imported as it is in IntelliJ under "Check out from Version Control"
or ,
Download the zip file and extract at a certain location and open as a project
(IntelliJ IDEA is recommended)

It is better to have Java 8 as it contains javafx module which was removed from the next java LTS i.e java 11
if using java 11 javafx must be downloaded seperately and included in the project and the java runtime environment must be set
    accordingly 

    to know how it works google about using javafx in java 11
